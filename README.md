ReWear-website
Problem Statement - Fast fashion is one of the biggest contributors to global textile waste. Millions of garments are thrown away each year despite being wearable. ReWear is a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing via direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. This promotes sustainable fashion, encourages reuse, and builds community trust through clothing exchange.
This project focus on making a web-based application in which anyone can swap or exchange their clothes and can see others people choices and trade with them based on their preferences. This idea is made to minimize the usage of materials used by textiles to make similar clothes again and again. This also promote trendy and fasionable look people search and cant find in their price range.
